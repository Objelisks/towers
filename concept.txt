*words of wisdom*
	words of wisdom
	scholars
	protected by its own remoteness
	A long time ago something existed that was not defined by name or known in its form. It blocked the sky and the earth.
	A cage went in search of a bird
	No longer gods

*artistic direction*
	shadow of the colossus
	tower of babel (pieter edition)

	http://magiccards.info/query?q=tower&v=card&s=cname
	color accents created with shadows and form

*tower style (i.e. rules to break)*
	central column
	radially symmetric
	tall thin cylinder
	stone
	penthouse
	airflow important
	light flowing out of the top in lines
	nothing else should be taller than tower in that area

*types of towers*
	made of earth solid rock, grass
	stone turbine
	globes
	lighthouse
	floating
	brutalism

*game mechanics*
	factions
	rock with high poly count face, dynamic carvable runes
	don't make it so flat, needs some climbing, sailing
	abstract representations
		individual npcs
			symbolic speech
			growing food
			gathering food
	story breadcrumbs
		one or two malevolent? npcs trying to destroy the towers for Reasons
		player can join them, share the power
		or try to stop them by multiple means, preserve global power
	pogonomancy
		beard magic

idea: towers provide magic for inhabitants of world, enhanced for nearby dwellers. player can destroy tower, taking power for self, but denying it to the rest of the world
	show previously destroyed towers
	perhaps an npc who did this themselves
		death spell

*metaphysics*
	heat
	sealevel
	information

*shader ideas*
	do something that stretches vertices as y(up) goes up
	horizon, spherical world


*environment*
	towers
		nothing immediately surrounding towers
		nothing taller than towers within eyesight except natural formations
		test natural formation destruction by towers
	villages

*where to start*
	landscape
	villages, supermega low poly
	movement, transport
	MAKE A WORLD THEN FILL IT WITH THINGS
	I think i would like the terrain that loads y values from data as you move
		move only camera y position, based on terrain not player height

*code structure*
	player
	terrain
		rocks
		trees
	village
		buildings
		npcs
	tower
		npcs
	magic
		effects
		runes


watchers
	too cliche, not enough interaction potential
maybe each tower provides a single spell
	supertech in fantasy world
	store locations of all towers, when you cast a spell, light travels from location of tower over horizon to self

So, we've got a bunch of giant towers, each one unique in its entirety.
They are unique because an individual designed and built it for some reason.
The Architects
	self imposed gods
	watchers
Telescopes
It is not allowed (re: structures taller than towers)
castles in the stone

Relative location of the towers
Inhabitants of the towers
Purpose of the towers
	line of sight
	stabilizes reality?
		architects are creators of the reality outside of their tower
		the edges of their influence fade into nothingness and unreason
